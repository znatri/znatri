## Hi there, I'm Hardik Goel! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Georgia Tech alumnus with a BS in Computer Science, specializing in Machine Learning (ML) and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). My journey spans developing autonomous systems for HRI research and building full-stack applications across various domains. I've successfully brought ideas to life, turning concepts into MVPs, using technologies like Python, C++, Next.js, AWS, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV.

Recently, I led the development of an AI-driven EdTech tool, which was licensed to a startup, and built ML pipelines for sports analytics. I also focused on advancing my AI/ML expertise through Neuromatch Academy's NeuroAI programs focusing on Computational Neuroscience.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a Co-Founder & CTO for a Stealth Startup with an upcoming GenAI product
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m interested in learning Generalizable Autonomy in Robotics and collaborate on interesting projects.
- ðŸ’¬ I enjoy playing Harmonium when I'm not working.
